00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Jake I grew up in the Appalachian Mountains and I know all of the rules.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I broke one of them a month ago ever since I keep feeling watched.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm 24 years old and a month ago I was drinking while on call with my best friend and he was also.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Drinking. His mother recently died of a heart attack he was feeling down.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It was about one in the morning I locked all my doors and closed my blinds.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He was talking about maybe coming over.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I wish I said no but I was drunk and not in the right state of mind.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He hangs up and I wait.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Around 15 minutes later I hear a knock.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I forgot to text him and confirm.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I go to open the door and see nothing.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I yell out his name.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You there? Nothing but the wind howling.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The forest was awfully quiet.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I shut the door and go back inside.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Minutes go by and I get a weird gut feeling.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It was all a haze was at 30 or 15 minutes I was drunk out of my mind I'm surprised I.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Remembered what happened.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For what seems like forever my phone chimes.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Jasper.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yo almost there be there in 10 minutes.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I look at the text and feel my heart drop.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What the fuck did I just do?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I nearly had a panic attack.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I heard Jasper's voice calling out from outside it sounded like a faint call in the wind.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I begin to hear taps on the windows all around.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I really don't know what it is but I've been hearing whispers in the other room and footsteps

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Knox.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For my friend I called him told him to go back home and we will remain on call for the rest

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
of the night.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I explained the whole situation to him.
